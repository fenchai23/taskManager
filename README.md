# taskManager

this is a project I made just for fun. I did it for those times I needed to quickly kill multiple processes.

## Microsoft was not able to create a searchbar into the existing Task Manager

so I made one...
Might not beat og Task Manager but it gets the job done in other ways og Task Manager can not.
